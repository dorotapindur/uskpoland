                    <p><b>“Life through the Shadows: A Three-Step Framework to See, Shape, and Sharpen”</b></p>
                    <p> In this immersive workshop, "Life through the Shadows," Alán Ramiro will guide participants through a transformative approach to urban sketching using his unique three-step framework: See, Shape, and Sharpen.  In this workshop details become a treat, and not a chore. By observing shadows first, we guide our vision to make forms by applying an ink wash or watercolor directly to the scene. Out of this process we then define contours and edges in ink and pen with selective admiration. What once was hard to imagine to sketch is now a delight through light and shadow. This method helps sketchers transcend the overwhelm of details and the pitfalls of perfectionism, turning the act of sketching into a joyous exploration of light and shadow.

                    <p><b>About the teacher</b></p>
                    <p><b>Alán Ramiro</b> - Driven by a passion for creating, connecting, and serving, Alán Ramiro brings his unique blend of nomadic travels to architecture design experience to the world of urban sketching. His decade of working in architecture in the United States multiplied by numerous travels around the world has honed his ability to translate complex structures into lively sketches.
                        During a recent sketching journey through Rome, Italy, Alán was met with the challenge of intricate facade details that birthed a new technique that revolutionized his approach – sketching shadows first. This simple yet powerful technique transformed the way he approaches architectural details, instilling freedom and energy into his sketches.
                        Alán knew he was an artist at the age of nine but life circumstances pushed it away until one day in 2013 his passion for art was reignited. During his architecture studies in Spain for one year he ran out of money and so Alán embraced the urgency to master sketching, giving rise to 'seethelines.'  Through rigorous visualization exercises, Alán discovered the transformative power of urban sketching for self-actualization. Now based in Lisbon after over 30 countries sketched, Alán's journey has evolved, embracing the dual roles of artist and educator on a path of creative exploration. His workshops guide sketchers to infuse personal experiences into their art, transcending mere replication. Urban sketching, for Alán, isn’t not just something we do for fun, it's a lifeline to honor the present and witness our growth in physical form throughout life.

                        I'll try to convince you that drawing people is a great thing, a reflex and line training, learning to let go of details, shape synthesis. Figures can be useful in your sketches, add a story or simply liven up urban scenes, appear in the foreground or in the background. In the limited time of the workshop, it's hard to master rapid and perfect sketching of people, but I'll show a few useful ways to tackle this topic. <br> <br>
                        I hope we'll also just have a good time!

                    <p>Workshop in English.</p>
                    <p>Learn to create vibrant urban sketches using gouache and mixed media techniques.

                        <br> <br>
                        Gouache offers a unique matte and opaque finish that’s perfect for urban scenes, enhancing the
                        depth and vibrancy of your artwork.

                        <br> <br>
                        In this workshop, we’ll explore unconventional methods to achieve a loose, expressive, and bold
                        artistic style. By blending gouache with dry mediums like colored pencils, crayons, and graphite, we’ll break traditional artistic norms.
                        We’ll begin by experimenting with textures and mixing materials, encouraging freeform strokes and irregular patterns. These initial exercises will help you embrace new artistic languages to capture the lively essence of the cityscape.

                        <br> <br>
                        Next, we’ll focus on creating mini-sketches of urban details. Here, we’ll use gouache for the
                        background and integrate colorful lines using dry techniques. We’ll work with spontaneous color
                        choices while emphasizing essential details to convey a sense of synthesis.
                        In the final part, we’ll explore into composition techniques, deforming perspectives and merging
                        various textures to craft a dynamic and fluid representation of the cityscape.

                    <p><b>“Fast sketching results with watercolour pencils”</b></p>
                    <p>Workshop in English.</p>
                    <p>The aim of the workshop is to show participants how to achieve fast sketching results with a limited range of water soluble colour pencils, followed by water as an additional element.<br> <br>
                        At the beginning of the workshop a number of thumbnail sketches will be done to decide on the composition and framing, as well as on the colour selection of maximum five colours for the actual sketch.<br> <br>
                        Once the preferred composition is selected we will start on a larger sheet: A3 size.
                        At the beginning the basic outlines will be set out using the brightest selected colour .
                        Afterwards we will define the basic shapes of the different coloured areas. The shapes themselves will get filled with varying patterns - based on the appearance of the actual object.
                        Using a water brush pen will define the different shapes and enhance selected coloured areas. At the same time the water is used to define the shadows.
                        <br> <br>
                        Depending on the result after about 45 minutes on the larger sheet, we will add a few marks in stronger colours to highlight specific characteristics of the subject - this could be either the outline of a person or a significant architectural feature.

                    <p>During the 3-hour workshop, we will do 2 quick exercises (max. 0.5 hours each) in the form of vignettes, small-sized, working with color spots in two versions:<br>
                        1. Previously made quick sketch, then loosely placed color spots using a reduced palette (up to 3 colors) and seeking contrasts between light and shadow.
                        <br>
                        2. We start with a color spot and then introduce the contour, finishing the sketch by applying color to achieve the effect of light and shadow.
                        <br> <br>
                        Definitive drawing, 2 hours:<br>
                        We will draw with pencil, pitt oil, microns, feathers, according to preference, and then transitioning to color, we will try to exceed the boundaries of the drawing by applying color spots so that the line is not an obstacle or limitation. Instead of coloring the drawing, we will try to make color a full-fledged and independent element of our composition, extending beyond the drawing's frame.

                        The participants will learn to envision their sketch as a sum of its parts (thus making peace with "mistakes"), to focus on drawing sceneries one careful line at a time and to prioritize elements of the sketch.

                <p><b>Detlef Surrey - Berlin – The Wall revisited</b></p>
                <p>Where was the Wall?" - this question was asked by many tourists to Detlef when they met him sketching in various places in Berlin.
                    So, WHERE was he?
                    This question intrigued Detlef and motivated him to visit places with his sketchbook where the Berlin Wall once stood.
                    Thanks to this curiosity, a sketchbook full of reportage sketches documenting the contemporary world with history in the background was created. A fascinating aspect of being an urban sketcher!</p>

                    <p>Day or night, the urban sketcher can benefit from sketching at any time. Contrary to common thought of confused visual conditions at night, the colors of the night are transmitted under the consistent street light glow. Alán Ramiro shares a demonstration of how to sketch at night capturing the multitude of reflections and shadows. The scene becomes a playground to play with watercolor washes while the night gives the benefit to exercise dark values especially for the depth of the dark sky.

                    <p><b>About the teacher</b></p>
                    <p><b>Alán Ramiro</b> - Driven by a passion for creating, connecting, and serving, Alán Ramiro brings his unique blend of nomadic travels to architecture design experience to the world of urban sketching. His decade of working in architecture in the United States multiplied by numerous travels around the world has honed his ability to translate complex structures into lively sketches.
                        During a recent sketching journey through Rome, Italy, Alán was met with the challenge of intricate facade details that birthed a new technique that revolutionized his approach – sketching shadows first. This simple yet powerful technique transformed the way he approaches architectural details, instilling freedom and energy into his sketches.
                        Alán knew he was an artist at the age of nine but life circumstances pushed it away until one day in 2013 his passion for art was reignited. During his architecture studies in Spain for one year he ran out of money and so Alán embraced the urgency to master sketching, giving rise to 'seethelines.'  Through rigorous visualization exercises, Alán discovered the transformative power of urban sketching for self-actualization. Now based in Lisbon after over 30 countries sketched, Alán's journey has evolved, embracing the dual roles of artist and educator on a path of creative exploration. His workshops guide sketchers to infuse personal experiences into their art, transcending mere replication. Urban sketching, for Alán, isn’t not just something we do for fun, it's a lifeline to honor the present and witness our growth in physical form throughout life.

            <h2 class="section__header">How to get to Świdnica</h2>
            <p class="section__text">If you travel by public transport, the easiest way to get to Świdnica is via Wrocław. You can easily get to Wrocław from all over Europe:</p>
            <ul class="program-list">
                <li>by train (e.g. directly from Berlin)</li>
                <li>by bus (e.g. Flixbus)</li>
                <li>by plane (Ryanair, Wizzair, LOT, Lufthansa, KLM... )</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section__text">In Wrocław, go to the Main Railway Station (Wrocław Główny) and buy a ticket to the Świdnica Miasto station from there. Connections to Świdnica are operated by Koleje Dolnośląskie. Railway connections Wrocław - Świdnica can be checked (in several languages) at <a href="https://koleo.pl/en/" class="link" aria-label="koleo.pl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>koleo.pl</a> - online tickets are also available there (after registration).</p>
            <p class="section__text">You can buy a paper ticket at the Wrocław train station - ticket machines are located in the square in front of the main entrance (the northern one, from the city center side). Inside the station there is one machine at the main entrance next to the stairs to the parking lot, and three at the southern entrance behind the ticket offices. Tickets can also be purchased at ticket offices (the staff does not necessarily speak English, we recommend machines or online purchase).</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you come to Wroclaw by bus, the main train station is on the opposite side of the street from the bus station exit. The city bus 106 runs from the airport to the station (every 15 minutes, the journey takes approx. 40-50 minutes).</p>
            <p class="section__text">The building of the Main Railway Station from the main entrance side is very nice, it is worth sketching while waiting for transfer.</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you are traveling by car, Google maps or Maps.me (also working offline) will certainly help you.</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you have more than 4 days, we encourage you to visit Wrocław and other numerous attractions in Lower Silesia (e.g. Książ Castle, Czocha Castle, Church of Peace in Jawor, Riese complex, etc., the list is quite long).</p>
            <p class="section__text">See you in Świdnica!</p>
