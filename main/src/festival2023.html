                <p><b>About the instructor</b></p>
                <p><b>Krzysztof Ludwin</b>  - a native of Krakow, inextricably and constantly connected with this city by work and creativity. For over a quarter of a century, his greatest passion has been watercolor, to which he devoted his artistic work, as well as his doctoral thesis. Studying the works of the classics of this technique, he is still experimenting in search of new means of expression. His paintings seem to be colorful poems whose main protagonists are light and color. With extraordinary skill, it reflects the transparency of the air, the subtle play of light and shadow, and the changing color reflections. He intuitively captures from reality what is fleeting and preserves the short-term impression and mood of the moment with watercolors. The subjects of his works are most of all urban scenes and landscapes.</p>

Participants will learn how to think about drawing a moving figure and what aspects to pay attention to and which to ignore. They will have the opportunity to learn to observe people and space in order to better plan the composition in the drawing.</p>
                    <p>During the workshop, we will also focus on the use of various means of expression to enhance the impression of movement. We will also talk about the impression sketch and discuss what it actually is and how to use it.</p>
                    <p>Using practical exercises, workshop participants will have the opportunity to test their skills and learn how to effectively translate their observations into a drawing.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I'm Krzysztof. I was born in Silesia in 1982. Since I was a child, I followed my love for games and comic books, and I never parted with a piece of paper and crayons. Today, I am primarily a creative computer game designer. However, my passion and escape from the monitor screen are traditional drawing and painting techniques. In my free time, I prepare young people for exams in drawing and painting. I can say without fear that in drawing I am mainly interested in the subject of people and movement, expressive, reportage capturing of the moment.</p>

                    <p>In these workshops, participants will have the opportunity to learn about the properties of various painting and drawing techniques and how to combine them. We will focus on the best possible use of a small amount of materials with a limited color palette. Thanks to the combination of paints and crayons, we will experiment with textures to obtain interesting effects. We will also play with the order of layering, because urban sketching is not only about adding color to the outline. The composition can be built using blots of color, and lines can be added next. The final effect depends on how well we know our materials, so let's have fun and experiment with them as much as possible!</p>

                    <p><b>Tine Klein</b> is an Urban Sketcher from Switzerland. Already during her studies in the field of Spatial Planning, she worked as a draftsman for urban planning and visualized social problems for a research institute. Then she realized that she was an artist.</p>
                    <p>Today, she works with anything she can always carry with her or find on the go, for example, beer coasters or river stones. Everything becomes art in her hands.</p>
                    <p>Tine Klein travels a lot, gaining experience while studying in many countries. She learned the most where her pen was her only language, because when words fail, the power of observation sharpens.</p>
                    <p>There is a simple solution to almost everything, even if it is sometimes hidden.
                    Art should be expressive, fun and simple. This is what Tine teaches in her painting courses.
                    Tine Klein works as an art lecturer at Atelier Herz der Kunst, Kunstverein Bremgarten and the Allensbach Art Academy. She exhibits her works in Switzerland, Germany and the USA.</p>

                    <p><b>“Contour and color”</b></p>
                    <p> is an expression of emotions and black and white drawing is an intellectual game of the artist with the subject. Sketching on location with a waterproof pen allows you to frame and define the motif that fascinated us. Supplementing with an abstract, imaginary color is a pleasure and relaxation. Yes, you can try to reflect reality, but ... why (in my humble opinion). So sketching, practicing observation skills and building form is mind training. Covering a black and white drawing with color reflects our emotions of the moment. We can forget our troubles for an instant. Thus, the exercise will be making a drawing on watercolor paper, preferably in a sketchbook, and covering it with color. Amen.

                    <p><b>Krzysztof Ludwin</b>  - a native of Krakow, inextricably and constantly connected with this city by work and creativity. For over a quarter of a century, his greatest passion has been watercolor, to which he devoted his artistic work, as well as his doctoral thesis. Studying the works of the classics of this technique, he is still experimenting in search of new means of expression. His paintings seem to be colorful poems whose main protagonists are light and color. With extraordinary skill, it reflects the transparency of the air, the subtle play of light and shadow, and the changing color reflections. He intuitively captures from reality what is fleeting and preserves the short-term impression and mood of the moment with watercolors. The subjects of his works are most of all urban scenes and landscapes.</p>

                    <p>During the workshop we will practice creating architectural sketches using watercolors. The main topic will be the creation of compositions that capture the dominant, simplification of complex views and the selection of consistent colors. I will also present the most important aspects of watercolor painting and share the technique of working with the right amount of water, paint density and building a sense of space in the image. After a short introduction, we will paint one painting in the open air, and I will present the painting process step by step by making a demonstration painting.</p> 
                    <p>The workshop is for both beginners and advanced adults aged 18+.</p>

                    <p><b>Kasia Wiercinska</b></p>
                    <p>I am a water artist, originally from Poland, currently living in Oslo, Norway. My profession is architecture, however, I decided to follow my dreams and become an artist.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my life, I was interested in many creative fields from painting and sculpture to architectural design. I have been using water as a self-taught artist from an early age. However, my new art journey started in Christchurch, New Zealand where I received professional water training in 2019-2020.</p>
                    <p>Travels and journeys are my main inspiration. I always try to capture the beauty and the atmosphere of the surrounding landscape wherever I go. For me, art is a great way to connect with the local landscape, observe activities of everyday life and feel the energy around us. When painting, I try to tell a story about a place, exactly as I want to remember it, so not always exactly what it looks like. My  subjects are cityscape and seascape, especially with boats or waves.</p>
                    <p>I really enjoy sharing my passion with others. Teaching water is a great way to do that. Currently, I give private tutoring in Oslo, as well as online. I run regular classes for artists at any level - both beginners and advanced.</p>

                    <p>Many people associate colored pencils with school supplies for children and they are sometimes underestimated by adult artists. Meanwhile, it is a very versatile, universal and practical medium that is gaining more and more popularity. During the workshop you will learn different types of colored pencils, how to use them and combine them with other techniques. You will find out how useful they are in urban sketching and why it is worth always having at least a few of them with you. I'll show you colored pencil exercises, tricks and different types of paper suitable for this technique, and then I will help you draw a sketch on location.</p>

                    <p>When you start a new sketch, do you ask yourself these questions:<br>
                    What should I draw?<br>
                    What is worth focusing on?<br>
                    What to leave out?<br>
                    In this workshop we will try to find answers. We will discuss where to start working and how you can create completely different sketches by changing the focus on different layers. We will learn how to look at what we draw to see the most important things.

                    <p><b>Oksana Mackowicz</b> - an artist of Ukrainian origin, working as an architect, which makes architecture one of her favorite topics for sketching. Each city is alive, has its own rhythm and heartbeat, and Oksana tries to show this in her works. He mostly uses graphic techniques: ink, pencil and markers, but he also likes watercolors. Meetings of the Urban Sketchers group are very important to her, because there she meets friendly people with passion, which is very inspiring and gives a huge impulse for development.</p>

                    <p><b>“Linear and aerial perspective - how light affects color” </b></p>
                    <p>We will start the workshop with a quick sketch in black and white, observing the scale of the value, using patches of light and shadow. The drawing will be very fast, schematic, the intensity of light becoming important here. We will make gray swatches on the side of the paper. We will spend up to 0.5 hours on this.</p> 
                    <p>We will draw the cathedral taking into account the aerial and linear perspective with three vanishing points. We will look for the colors of the stone and how light and shadow modify these colors.</p>

                    <p><b>Iwona Flaszczyńska</b> graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, the Faculty of Conservation of Works of Art, specializing in Painting and Polychrome Sculpture. She received a scholarship to Mexico, where she eventually lived for 4 years, working on important conservation projects.</p>
                    <p>Since 1990, he has been living in Spain, where he teaches and creates his own work.
                    She traveled a lot, mainly in Latin American countries, taking part in projects of non-governmental organizations, which allowed her to get to know the people, culture and traditions that became a source of inspiration for her work.
                    She has had many solo and group exhibitions in Mexico and Spain.
                        </p>
                    <p>Since 2010, he has been actively involved in the Urban Sketchers Barcelona movement.
                    She loves traveling, getting to know other cultures, mountains and hiking, beaches out of season and the less populated the better, good museums and exhibitions, and above all... drawing, which constantly evokes great emotions in her!

            <h2 class="section__header">How to get to Świdnica</h2>
            <p class="section__text">If you travel by public transport, the easiest way to get to Świdnica is via Wrocław. You can easily get to Wrocław from all over Europe:</p>
            <ul class="program-list">
                <li>by train (e.g. directly from Berlin)</li>
                <li>by bus (e.g. Flixbus)</li>
                <li>by plane (Ryanair, Wizzair, LOT, Lufthansa, KLM... )</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section__text">In Wrocław, go to the Main Railway Station (Wrocław Główny) and buy a ticket to the Świdnica Miasto station from there. Connections to Świdnica are operated by Koleje Dolnośląskie. Railway connections Wrocław - Świdnica can be checked (in several languages) at <a href="https://koleo.pl/en/" class="link" aria-label="koleo.pl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>koleo.pl</a> - online tickets are also available there (after registration).</p>
            <p class="section__text">You can buy a paper ticket at the Wrocław train station - ticket machines are located in the square in front of the main entrance (the northern one, from the city center side). Inside the station there is one machine at the main entrance next to the stairs to the parking lot, and three at the southern entrance behind the ticket offices. Tickets can also be purchased at ticket offices (the staff does not necessarily speak English, we recommend machines or online purchase).</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you come to Wroclaw by bus, the main train station is on the opposite side of the street from the bus station exit. The city bus 106 runs from the airport to the station (every 15 minutes, the journey takes approx. 40-50 minutes).</p>
            <p class="section__text">The building of the Main Railway Station from the main entrance side is very nice, it is worth sketching while waiting for transfer.</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you are traveling by car, Google maps or Maps.me (also working offline) will certainly help you.</p>
            <p class="section__text">If you have more than 4 days, we encourage you to visit Wrocław and other numerous attractions in Lower Silesia (e.g. Książ Castle, Czocha Castle, Church of Peace in Jawor, Riese complex, etc., the list is quite long).</p>
            <p class="section__text">See you in Świdnica!</p>
